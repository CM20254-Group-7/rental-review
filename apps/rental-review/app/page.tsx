          This web app is designed to help tenants
          view properties and get verified information
          about them from previous tenants. Users are
          able to leave reviews for a property or
          landlord. Equally, we help tenants and landlords to
          verify reviews and report any misinformation.

      <Card title='About Us'>
        <p className='ml-5 mr-5'>
          We are a diverse collection of students
          from the University of Bath, located in
          the United Kingdom. We are working together
          on this project with the sole purpose of
          helping tenants (and landlords) get better
          information about where they&apos;ll be living,
          along with information about landlords
          which might not be freely available.
          <br />
          <br />
          The goal of this is to balance the power dynamic
          between tenants and landlords, the latter of which
          being capable of verifying information about tenants,
          which is not applicable the other way around. We
          want to avoid problems such as landlords leaving the
          house in unliveable conditions, or more minor things
          such as the landlord being impossible to contact.
