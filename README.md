# Rental Review

This repository contains the source code for the Rental Review project.

This project is being created by Group 7 as part of the CM20314 Experimental Systems Project module at the University of Bath.

The website is accessible at [rentalreview.co.uk](https://rentalreview.co.uk)

## Our Goal

Our goal is to create a web application that allows users to review and rate places they have rented, with an emphasis on landlords.

We aim to bridge the gap in knowledge between landlords and tenants, by providing a platform for tenants to share their experiences with landlords and properties in a world where landlords already expect to recieve references for tenants.

We hope that this will not only allow tenants to make more informed decisions when choosing a place to rent, but also encourage landlords to provide better service to their tenants, and reward those who already do.

## Tech Stack

The projecy is built mostly in Next.js 14, with a Supabase backend.

It is being hosted on Vercel.
